# keras-code-sample-studies

My notebooks for studying sample codes provided in the Keras website.

# 
All codes in this repo are based on code samples provided in https://keras.io/examples/.

There may be some small alternations in the markdowns or in the codes, mostly for accomandating my code style while running the notebooks.

Be sure to check the original samples out, they are great material for learning Tensorflow/Keras or Deep Learning in general.
